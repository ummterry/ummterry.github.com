Iâ€™m Terry, a software engineer.

I started this blog because as is said, every programmer blogs himself.

Although blogging may be as important as open sourcing in that it might help others with the same problems, I was never able to start a blog for my poor language skill. However, It came to me that blogging is on the other hand a good way to improve my English, for which I made up my mind today.

Yoroshiku!
