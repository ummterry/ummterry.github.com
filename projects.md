Here are some of the open source projects that I worked on.

# [Weixin-PC](http://ummterry.github.io/Weixin)

Weixin-PC is the PC client software for [Wechat](http://wechat.com) (微信), the famous messaging App with half billion users. Weixin-PC is avaiable on both Windows and Mac OS X. With sweet functions such as push notifications, the client has earned quite a user base before Tencent rolled out their official version.
